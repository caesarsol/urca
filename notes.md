# Notes

## How to use

You have to create your own directory with the name of the project, enter in this folder and then run `yo urca`.
This because the generator doesn't create the directory project but it creates all the stuffs in the folder you are so you have to be in the right directory before to generate your project.

## To test

Go to accurat/generator-urca-test and run `yo urca`.
